# üåå WEAVE

> A revolutionary IDE & compiler for transforming code into executable QR patterns.

## ‚ú® Overview

WEAVE is a groundbreaking development environment that bridges traditional programming with QR-based code execution. Built on the experimental technologies developed in [STARWEB](https://github.com/isdood/STARWEB), WEAVE enables developers to write, compile, and execute code through the medium of QR patterns.

## üéØ Core Features

### üñ•Ô∏è Integrated Development Environment
- Syntax highlighting for QR pattern-oriented code
- Real-time QR pattern preview
- Intelligent code completion with QR optimization suggestions
- Integrated debugging tools for QR-based execution flows
- Split-view editing: traditional code alongside QR representation

### üîÑ Advanced Compiler
- Direct compilation of source code to QR patterns
- Multiple output format support (Static QR, QR-Flipbook, Recursive QR)
- Optimization engine for maximum data density
- Pattern validation and verification system
- Integration with STARWEB's experimental QR technologies

### üì± Runtime Environment
- Native QR code execution engine
- Real-time pattern interpretation
- State management for QR-based applications
- Performance monitoring and optimization tools

## üöÄ Getting Started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: WEAVE is currently in active development.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/isdood/WEAVE.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd WEAVE

# Install dependencies (coming soon)
```

## üîß Technical Architecture

WEAVE operates on a multi-layer architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - Modern IDE interface
   - Code editor with QR-specific features
   - Pattern visualization tools

2. **Compiler Core**
   - Source code analysis
   - Pattern generation engine
   - Integration with STARWEB backend

3. **Runtime Environment**
   - Pattern execution engine
   - State management system
   - Performance optimization layer

## üîó Integration with STARWEB

WEAVE leverages cutting-edge features from STARWEB, including:
- QR-Flipbook technology for dynamic code execution
- Recursive QR generation for complex programs
- STARWEAVE-specific patterns for enhanced data density
- Custom encoding methods for optimized execution

## üìò Documentation

Comprehensive documentation will be available covering:
- IDE usage and features
